# 🎯 Guess The Number Game

This is a simple Python terminal game where the computer picks a number between 1 and 20, and you try to guess it in fewer than 6 tries.

## 🚀 How it works

- The game selects a random number from 1 to 20.
- You have up to **6 chances** to guess it.
- After each guess, you'll get a hint if the number is higher or lower.
- The game ends either when you guess correctly or use all your attempts.

## 🧠 Example Gameplay
```
Hi! What's your name?

Nice to meet you, John! Let's play a game.
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Try to guess it in less than 6 attempts.
Take a guess: 10
Too low!
Take a guess: 15
Too high!
Take a guess: 13
🎉 YAAAAYYY, good job John! You guessed the number in 3 guesses!
