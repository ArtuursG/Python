# 🐍 Python Mini Projects & Tools

This repository includes a collection of small yet educational Python projects and system tools developed during my learning journey. Each file demonstrates different aspects of Python programming, from game logic and data visualization to system health checks.

## 🎮 Games

### [`guess_the_number.py`](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python/blob/main/Number_guess/guess_the_number.py)
A console-based number guessing game where the user has 6 attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 20.

### [`BMW_quiz.py`](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python/blob/main/Quiz/BMW_quiz.py)
A BMW-themed quiz game with 7 multiple-choice questions. It tracks lives, calculates scores, and saves the result to a file.

## 🌍 Data Visualization

### [`covid-map.ipynb`](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python/tree/main/covid-map)
A Jupyter Notebook that visualizes global COVID-19 case data using `folium` and `pandas`. It includes:
- Choropleth maps
- Circle markers with confirmed/recovered counts
- Heat maps for death toll intensity

Data is fetched from the [COVID-19 API](https://api.covid19api.com/) and enriched with country coordinates.

## 🛠️ System Health Tools

### [`all_checks.py`](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python/blob/main/pc-health-check/all_checks.py) & [`all_checks2.py`](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python/blob/main/pc-health-check/all_checks2.py)
Scripts to verify basic system health:
- Checks if a system reboot is required
- Verifies root partition disk space

### [`disk_usage.py`](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python/blob/main/pc-health-check/disk_usage.py)
Checks if a disk has enough free space (at least 2 GB or 10%).
